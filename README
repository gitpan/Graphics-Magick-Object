Graphics-Magick-Object

This module hopes to act as an object-oriented wrapper around
Graphics::Magick, adding a Perlish layer to a very C-based library.
Specifically, I would like Graphics::Magick to throw exceptions
when things go wrong, for individual images to be objects which
can be manipulated, and for the core object to have a list of
identifiable objects. I'll also fix what I see as flaws with
G::M, such as returning Magick codes instead of MIME types and
anything else that pops up. The idea is that I::M can remain as
a backward compatible straight-to-libmagick layer, while I::M::O
can be easy to use layer on top of it.

Future goals include transparently wrapping around both
Graphics::Magick and Graphics::Magick, whichever one happens
to be installed.
